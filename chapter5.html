    <h2 id="bayesian_inference">Bayesian Inference</h2>
    <p>Bayesian inference is a statistical method used in AI for updating probabilities based on new evidence. It provides a framework for reasoning under uncertainty and is applied in various AI applications, including probabilistic graphical models and Bayesian networks.</p>
    
    <h2 id="reinforcement_learning">Reinforcement Learning</h2>
    <p>Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. It is commonly used in AI applications such as game playing, robotics, and autonomous systems.</p>
    
    <h2 id="evolutionary_computing">Evolutionary Computing</h2>
    <p>Evolutionary computing is inspired by the process of natural selection and genetic algorithms. It involves optimizing solutions to complex problems by iteratively evolving a population of candidate solutions through processes like mutation, recombination, and selection.</p>
    
    <h2 id="complex_systems_theory">Complex Systems Theory</h2>
    <p>Complex systems theory studies the behavior of complex adaptive systems composed of many interacting components. It provides insights into emergent phenomena and self-organization, which are relevant to understanding and designing AI systems.</p>

    <h2 id="hci">Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)</h2>
    <p>HCI is the study of how people interact with computers and technology. In the context of AI, HCI research focuses on designing user interfaces and interaction techniques that facilitate effective communication and collaboration between humans and AI systems.</p>
