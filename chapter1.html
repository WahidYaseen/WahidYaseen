    <h2 id="machine_learning">Machine Learning</h2>
    <p>At the heart of AI lies machine learning, which focuses on developing algorithms that enable computers to learn from data and improve over time without explicit programming.</p>
    
    <h2 id="neural_networks">Neural Networks</h2>
    <p>Inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, neural networks are computational models composed of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, utilizes neural networks with many layers to analyze complex patterns in data.</p>
    
    <h2 id="cognitive_science">Cognitive Science</h2>
    <p>AI researchers draw insights from cognitive science, the study of how the mind processes information. By understanding human cognition, AI systems can be designed to perceive, reason, and learn like humans.</p>
