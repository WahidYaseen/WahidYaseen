    <h2 id="pattern_recognition">Pattern Recognition</h2>
    <p>Pattern recognition is fundamental to AI and involves the identification of patterns and regularities in data. It is used in various AI applications, including speech recognition, handwriting recognition, and medical diagnosis.</p>
    
    <h2 id="knowledge_representation">Knowledge Representation and Reasoning</h2>
    <p>This area of AI focuses on developing formal methods for representing knowledge in a structured format that computers can manipulate to perform reasoning tasks. It enables AI systems to make informed decisions based on available information.</p>
    
    <h2 id="algorithmic_game_theory">Algorithmic Game Theory</h2>
    <p>Algorithmic game theory combines elements of computer science, mathematics, and economics to study strategic interactions between rational agents in computational settings. It is used to design algorithms and mechanisms for multi-agent systems and auctions, among other applications.</p>
